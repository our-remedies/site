The hungry will search you out.\nOur people are desperate for hope - they want the real thing. These cards are custom tailored for Christ\u0026rsquo;s presence to prevail - healing for the sick. This box of direction brings the experience of HIS presence - HIS visitation - bread for the hungry.\nGenerally, any particulat healing program should last four (4) months. Nonetheless a shorter program or a longer program may be the rule. The practitioner will guide the client or perhaps the client will become so aware of his/her own helaing protentials that the program becomes self-controlled. that is really the ultimate hope.\nBe mindful to drink at least one quart of distilled water a day to flush out dislodged debris. Fifteen minutes of sunlight and being out in fresh air accentuates the healing potential. Good food invigorates wellness. Symptoms of change include headaches, nausea, brain fog, dizziness, fatigue, sugar cravings, skin outbreaks, cold hand and feet. These are temporary yet positive signs that the program is working. The symptoms can last for hours or up to 3 days. If the symptoms interfere with normal daily activities reduce the tablet intake.\nA quick way to add balance and keep the program going is to add 1 teaspoon of pediolyte to 3 oz. white grape juice once or twice a day for several days or even weeks.\nThe information in this collection will always be shy of the whole truth.\n"

NU•ADJUNCT heals alone as a sole potential or integrates especially well within a program of other remedies. It is a composite of foods that are specific in their potential to remediate illnesses. Included are cranberry, to address the bladder; zinc, which acts as a boost to the whole immune system; horehound, an old remedy for relieving congestion in mucus membranes; and rosehips, to add tone and healing to inflamed and weakened veins and arteries. NU•ADJUNCT is a formulation designed for you when you don¹t know what to do. NU•ADJUNCT acts as a partner to make other remedies work more effectively.\nThe following brief paragraphs detail the individual components in NUlADJUNCT. Through these you will understand the logical unlocking of this formula\u0026rsquo;s expertise.\nCranberry (365 mg); has been included because it will address bacterial infection in the bladder that in turn creates a pH imbalance in the blood. Muscles begin to ache and lose elasticity and as a result, for more and more of our people, they complain of hurting joints and muscles, especially the knees. A sub-clinical bladder infection is undetected but subtle symptoms are itchy ears, dry and sore throat, a ticky tacky cough, low grade intermittent fevers or chills and low-grade back tiredness. Cranberry alleviates the cause.\nZinc (3.5 mg); is a major mineral indicated when tissues wear out faster than they are repaired. One might notice spinal affections, twitching, marked anemia, fidgety feet and weak memory. Zinc is important in the formation of insulin and to protein syntheses. It is indicated for its importance in brain function.\nHorehound (280 mg); is an often overlooked herb of outstanding healing potential. It was a standby in days of old but in recent years has lost much of its acclaim due to research of other herbs and their rise to fame. Yet, horehound reigns as a superb healer acting as an expectorant and relaxing to the bronchi. It eases congestion; thereby breathing is relaxed and croupy coughs allayed.\nRosehips(48 mg); are my favored source of vitamin C, used herein as a kidney tonic and for urinary dysfunctions. Rosehips are cleansing, act as antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory. Rosehips also act as a sedative and blood tonic.\nCan you see how NU•ADJUNCT gives support to the body\u0026rsquo;s healing powers?\nIf this particular remedy appeals to your questions about your health, please understand that prudence is advised if you are controlling health issues with medication from your practitioner. Thaumaturge is for those who seek a more natural way of healing. Thaumaturge is expressly designed using God\u0026rsquo;s gifts naturally.\nSuggested Use: Three (3) tablets a day, one (1) after each meal. May take up to six (6) a day. Use in combination with other Thaumaturge remedies as support, but is sufficient to itself.\n"

Thaumaturge represents a concept that nature provides food that heals.\nNU•EGRESS is a combination of three herbs along with L-Glutathione, (an amino acid), which in effect singularly addresses the acid/alkaline pH balance of the body. An imbalance of the blood pH enlivens an environment wherein the muscles stiffen. In this condition muscles do not stretch nor contract with ease but feel taut and ache. The soreness lingers. Tight muscles pull at odd angles on joints and symptoms commonly referred to as rheumatism, gout, tennis elbow, stiff neck, spasms, cramps, tics, kidney and gall stones manifest.Balancing other remedies in partnership NU•EGRESS intensifies the healing outcome.\nIncluded in NU•EGRESS is:\nWild Lettuce (142 mg): increases urine flow. It has sedative properties that address chronic pain, nervous disorders, and cramps. Oddly, too, it cleans out old and new accumulation of poison ivy, which by the way, will often settle in the joints and cause pain and spasms even years later. Wild lettuce helps, too, to balance pH from an acid.\nSarsaparilla (142 mg): is included as a glandular balancer. It increases circulation in rheumatic joints. Sarsaparilla provides Vitamin D and the mineral Copper-both excellent nutrients for the joints. It is a blood purifier-good for gout and joint aches. Because sarsaparilla is a hormone herb, it is inherently stimulating to the entire body.\nEucalyptus (120 mg): has antiseptic qualities and helps to prevent infections. It is a purifier and specific for pain, paralysis, stiff muscles, and spasms of muscles. Also, a stimulant, Eucalyptus will help to reduce blood sugar levels.\nL-Glutathione (17 mg): is a specific amino acid that protects cell membranes from free radical damage. Studies show that it potentially breaks down fat peroxides that can contribute to congestion of the veins and arteries. L-Glutathione helps with energizing (anti-fatigue) through its action with the red blood cells. It is also valuable in its involvement with neutralizing toxins.\nIf this particular remedy appeals to your questions about your health, please understand that prudence is advised if you are controlling health issues with medication from your practitioner. Thaumaturge is for those who seek a more natural way of healing. Thaumaturge is expressly designed using God\u0026rsquo;s gifts naturally.\nSuggested Use: Three (3) tablets a day; 1 before each meal, or up to twelve for a more intense program.\n"

NU•GALLANT is designed for those who desire to keep their muscles integrity honed and toned. You might want to put NU•GALLANT as a companion support to NU•EGRESS, which addresses muscles too, but only when discomfort comes from an imbalance of the \u0026lsquo;pH\u0026rsquo; factors.\nAlone, NU•GALLANT is a metabolic enhancer, which improves and optimizes physical and mental performance during periods of physical stress and is especially beneficial for weight lifters.\nIncluded are:\nQueen-of-the-Meadow (75 mg): is especially useful for ills of the joints, including aching and sprained back, strains and sprains, pulled ligaments and tendons. It is useful in treating water retention.\nBurdock Root (45 mg): is often called upon as a blood purifier. It has remarkable abilities to reduce swelling around joints and helps rid calcification deposits. It helps clear the blood of harmful acids. Burdock helps the pituitary gland in releasing an ample supply of protein to adjust hormone balance in the body. A poorly nourished pituitary gland is often responsible for overweight. Famous as a remedy for fevers, gout, nervousness and skin diseases, burdock gives this formula support to intensify muscle strength.\nRed Raspberry (154 mg): is rich in iron thereby enriching the body�s energy resource. Red Raspberry is good for stopping nausea. It helps with hemorrhoids. Red Raspberry is most usually considered an herb to women reliable to stimulating, toning and regulating the procreative organs, but is also acts as a tonic for the prostate gland. In action, Red Raspberry intensifies hormonal balances, thusly muscles are strengthened.\nGuarana (62 mg): has a stimulating effect. It is reputed to increase mental alertness and to fight fatigue. It has tonic properties and helps the body reduce water retention. I have added Guarana specifically to harmonize the activity of the lower back muscles. Guarana has a regulating influence on the muscles in general.\nCatuaba (49 mg): is an obscure herb from South America. It is included in this formula to supplement the enzyme SOD (superoxide dimutase). I wanted that enzyme to be a plant source so I chose Catuaba to increase the sense of well-being and lessen fatigue and help fight diseases associated with aging. Catuaba has been included to aid muscle strength and resilient skin and in general to accentuate a more youthful appearance.\nCalcium Pangamate (78 mg): is a derivative of apricot kernel included in this formula for improving the health, helping with better performance at exercising programs and greatly enhancing well-being. It increases the muscles� acceptance of prolonged vigorous activity and also improves mental concentration. This highly valuable nutritional supplement helps to increase available oxygen to tissues.\nGrape Seed Extract (13 mg): is a potent antioxidant of superior power. Its selection for this formula, though, is due to the grape seeds� anti-inflammatory properties, thus it helps muscles respond with smoother resilience to exertion. Grape Seed Extract helps, too, to lessen that tired, sore feeling one feels the next day after a \u0026ldquo;work out\u0026rdquo; of physical activity.\nSuggested Use: One (1) tablet before and after a training program and two (2) additional tablets after a meal.\n"

Anti-inflammatory in action, Sarsaparilla increases circulation to rheumatic joints to help relieve arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.\nComponents in Sarsaparilla aid in the production of testosterone and progesterone, which helps to remediate sexual impotence, physical debility and weakness. Sarsaparilla is a tonic to help purify the blood and increases the flow of urine to dispel excess water retention.\nRenowned for its potential to accentuate the production of thymosin by the thymus, Sarsaparilla then plays a critical role in the body\u0026rsquo;s defenses against infections. The thymus\u0026rsquo; health has an important role in the body\u0026rsquo;s immune system and Sarsaparilla is effective as a stimulator to that particular gland.\nSenna (10 mg); is an herb that has a stimulating laxative personality. It�s somewhat prompt cathartic action acts on nearly the entire intestinal tract to purge and cleanse it for greater absorption of nutrients to feed the body for wellness. Senna can appear as a reddish tint on the urine or the feces so do not be alarmed.\nIn small doses Senna will not tire the system. NU•ILLATION has a minimal addition of Senna as a working component. Senna enriches oxygen to the blood therefore, is very effective against eruptive diseases like skin ulcers or sores so typical with diabetes.\nNU•ILLATION can be paired with NU•LACTONE for a more aggressive program or with NU•NEFARIOUS if a hiatal hernia is an aggravating issue.\nSuggested Use: One (1) tablet, three (3) times a day on an empty stomach.

	"content": " FOR SKIN SYMPTOMS NU•LOESS by Thaumaturge is an unusual curative remedy based on homeopathic requirements. Homeopathy is a scientific philosophy that assumes that there is an internal wisdom within the body to heal itself. Homeopathy then provides relief for pain and discomfort by allowing the body�s natural defenses to heal itself. NU•LOESS provides the impetus toward healing through a homeopathically prepared combination of herbs specific to skin symptoms. NU•LOESS is a healing balm made of homeopathically prepared substances held in a base of glycerin and petrolatum. Consider the following potentials of each ingredient.\nHamamelis Virginica (Witch Hazel): is specific to venous congestion, varicose veins and hemorrhoids, with bruised soreness. Hamamelis relaxes veins and appeases engorgement and supercedes as a remedy for pain. Often called upon for varicose veins and ulcers, Hamamelis is wonderful, too, for inflammations in the veins and on the skin. In this formula Hamamelis was chosen for its subtle healing potential when the situation calls for relaxation of tissue, for ease of pain and as a balm for inflammation to relax toward healing.\nCollisonia Canadesis (Stone Root): is an old remedy for rectal disquiets as in resulting hemorrhoids, piles, constriction or sticking pains in the rectum and/or on the lips. Collisonia deals with aches, protrusions of tissue, and when there can be pain or bleeding from exertion or stress upon delicate tissue. Collisonia brings sure relief where the specific area is warm, moist and particularly where small muscles in constant tension are interplaying in their work. Examples would be the �puckering� action of the rectum or of the lips � both intricate muscles structures affected by emotions, heart symptoms, respiratory ailments, menstruation, or liver stagnation.\nPrimala Obconica (Primrose): is ideally suited when there are blisters on the skin and the tissue is tense as in moist eczema whether it be eruptions, blisters or else cracking. Itching can be a problem as part of the skin symptoms.\nTaraxacum (Dandelion): has been chosen for this remedy due to its personality to affect the liver which when disquieted or dis-eased will symptomize as cold sores, fever blisters and hemorrhoids. Taraxacum is especially useful when along with skin symptoms.\nValeriana (Valerian): was chosen as a remedy in this formula for its action when over-sensitiveness becomes a physical debilitation and resultant nervous affections such as pressure, constipation, spasms and pain create hurt at soft tissue areas.\nSuggested Use: NU•LOESS is an ointment as a restorative. Massage a tad of the cream onto the affected place and keep the area moist with the salve. Once the salve is applied body heat will warm up the oil base and the salve can then be easily caressed into the area.\n"

NU•REDACT is accentuated in combination with NU•SQUEEG, a natural anti-biotic, nonetheless, NU•REDACT is powerful as a single remedy.\nQuercetin (425 mg); found in yellow onions, broccoli, and red grapes and wine, fights viruses and bacteria. This antioxidant bioflavonoid is known to also lower cholesterol and reduce unwanted blood clots. Quercetin is a phytochemical found in many fruits and vegetables that offer many proven health benefits. In this formula, Quercetin is a strident force as a nutrient to accentuate the transmission of signals up and down the spinal cord to and from the brain.\nL-Glutathione (50 mg); is an amino acid indicated as a nutrient in any individual\u0026rsquo;s requirements. In this formula, L-Glutathione helps as a deactivator of free radicals (immune system suppressors) mutagents, carcinogens, genetic alterations within the cell, and the increased characteristic signs of aging interfering with circulation and drainage.\nL-Glutathione increases one\u0026rsquo;s ability to detoxify, to enhance the immune protective status, and is helpful in assisting the liver in its detoxification.\nGoldenseal Root (90 mg); is a traditional herb of Native America used for indigestion, local inflammations, and to improve the appetite. Also for whooping cough, liver disorders, fevers, reduces phlegm and dries up mucus in nasal, respiratory and colon tracts; good for vaginal discharges and yeast infections. In this remedy, Goldenseal Root is a vital component to assist in the remediating toward wellness.\nPregnenolone (3 mg); is a hormone produced in the brain and adrenal cortex from cholesterol; it is the �parent� hormone for DHEA and other key hormones. As a brain power hormone, Pregnenolone enhances memory, improves concentration and keeps the brain at peak capacity. In this formula, the Pregnenolone will help to vitalize the brain toward increased vigor and help to \u0026ldquo;chase away\u0026rdquo; that lethargic feeling one can have when one feels ill.\nPennyroyal (220 mg); is a very reliable and effective tonic, excellent for feverish conditions, bronchial congestion, eruptive diseases, soothing and relaxing to conditions when spasms, nervousness and crossness generalize the personality. Good for coughs, flu, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dizziness, and pulmonary congestion, Pennyroyal is a first-rate protection. For some, Pennyroyal may cause reflex uterine movement and that is why some herbalists do not recommend Pennyroyal during pregnancy, nonetheless, Pennyroyal is reliable for retarded or obstructed menstruation.\nIrish Moss (120 mg); is a wonderful source of potassium chloride, so very important to restore the balance of the blood, enabling the body to expectorate mucus from the bronch-pulmonary membrane. Irish Moss soothes, softens, and allays irritation of mucous membranes, protecting them against irritation, relieves the pain, and nourishes toward healing. Irish Moss is particularly valuable to purify and cleanse the body. Mucus is nature\u0026rsquo;s warning signal that a thorough cleansing is needed.\nSuggested Use: One (1) tablet every four (4) hours; two (2) in the morning and two (2) in the afternoon.\n"

	"content": " CIRCULATION BOOSTER NU•THANE belongs to the Thaumaturge line of holistic remedies designed for those who desire healing, seeking it through natural means.\nNU•THANE is a specific remedy for the heart. The name THANE implies \u0026ldquo;defender, a soldier for a higher cause\u0026rdquo; and in our body the heart is a dominant force helping us in our defense to stay well.\nNU•THANE is for cleansing of veins and arteries, intensifying circulation thus alleviating water retention, purging the kidneys and bladder of debris, enhancing the brain with increased circulation of nutrients, strengthening the very heart and its action and its blood supply. NU•THANE deals with issues of libido, energy, warmth and vibrance.\nThe active ingredients included are:\nBuchu (136 mg): is for treatment of water retention and urinary tract infections. Its tonic qualities are also specific to prostate problems and yeast infections. Buchu has been included specifically to relieve water retention about the lungs.\nZinc Citrate (26 mg): is a major mineral. Citrate was chosen for its ease of absorption. Zinc acts like a \u0026ldquo;traffic policeman\u0026rdquo; in the body directing the efficient maintenance of enzyme systems and cells in the uninhibited flow of body processes. Zinc helps in the making of insulin and is essential for protein synthesis. Because it helps to maintain an acid-alkaline balance, muscles \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; with smoother ease. Zinc is indicated for its importance in brain function to increase mental alertness. Studies indicate that zinc decreases cholesterol, accelerates healing time and promotes growth.\nL-Proline (270 mg): is an isolate amino acid included to balance electrolytes in cases of dehydration which causes an acid condition.\nL-Proline is a major constituent of collagen-the main fibrous protein found in bone, cartilage and other connective tissue.

They are included in the remedy, also, for blood pressure associated with liver disharmony, which causes constriction of veins, and arteries bringing on suffering of varicosity. Lycii Berries help, too, to lower blood sugar.\nDeer Antler (95 mg): You will probably find it amazing that this ingredient has been added but its inherent \u0026ldquo;goodness\u0026rdquo; is its soothing and revitalizing qualities which aid with a fresher and more assertive attitude about life in general. Its emotional uplifting aspect is worthy but its real strength intensifies heart action.\nBeta Sitosterol (30 mg): is added to relax muscles, to relieve muscle spasms and that \u0026ldquo;charley-horse grip\u0026rdquo;.\nPossibly you might experience some light-headedness for the first two days due to the Beta Sitosterol\u0026rsquo;s enhancement of oxygen to the brain. NU•THANE is food which nurtures, so insist on two quarts of water with a dash of lime juice for the first three days then at least one quart daily to purge the debris broken loose in the cleaning process.\nSuggested Use: One (1) tablet after each of three (3) meals and one (1) before bedtime: or one (1) after breakfast, two (2) after lunch and one (1) after dinner.

Suited for this formula, the word TOMBAC dares to suggest itself as a remedy for conditions when fibrinous growths impede health. Designed to bring stasis to erratic cell divisions, NU•TOMBAC is a collection of foods that have potential to heal. If a fibrinous growth has already grown or is in progress, NU•TOMBAC is a vibrant protocol; NU•PASSANT follows with its ability to dissolve growth(s).\nEach component is listed below with brief characterization to its personality.\nShavegrass (60 mg); is one of the finest cleansing herbs we have. It also helps to revitalize the body with the proper amount of silicon. It is an herb good for kidneys, bladder, gas, varicose veins, and mucous membranes. It removes toxic material from the body, good in all ulcer injuries, skin conditions, psoriasis, wounds and sores.\nStillingia (415 mg); is a particularly powerful herb. As an alternative, it is an effective glandular stimulant and especially valuable for ridding the \u0026ldquo;systems\u0026rdquo; of toxic drugs - particularly, I think, caused by chemotherapy and misuse of pharmaceuticals. Good too for respiratory problems, Stillingia will also give relief to urinary problems. Oddly, Stillingia works best in combination with other herbs.\nDevil\u0026rsquo;s Claw (525 mg); is a potent anti-inflammatory with action comparable to cortisone. It positively affects diabetes; kidney and bladder disease with help to soften hardened vascular walls. Devil\u0026rsquo;s Claw has properties as natural cleansing agents, which clear the body of toxic impurities especially from the lymph and blood. It is a \u0026ldquo;sweet\u0026rdquo; remedy for gallstones and malaria, which is a dormant microbe that lingers in the blood and can resurface once the immune system is labored. Malaria\u0026rsquo;s impact upon the vibrance of the blood is insidious but sorely hurtful.\nL-Ornithine (500 mg); is an amino acid which specific attributes prompts the release of growth hormones, which promotes the metabolism of excess body fat. Necessary for proper immune system and liver function,\nL-Ornithine detoxifies ammonia and helps to regenerate a dysfunctional liver. As a component to healing, L-Ornithine promotes healing and repair of damaged tissues.\nPropolis (500 mg); is a sterilized resin collected by honeybees used as a putty to seal cracks and openings in the hives and combs. Abundant with flavonoids and uniquely rich in the caffeic acid phenethyl ester propolis inhibits cancer growth. It is renown for its terpenoids which constituents contribute antibiotic, antifungal and antiviral effects.\nWhole Grain Yellow Cornmeal (48 mg); is a complete protein providing fiber. Enriched with the complexities of amino acids, cornmeal is a brainfood; good for the nervous system. Cornmeal also lowers cholesterol and aids in preventing hardening of the arteries. As a food, it builds bone and muscles. I have chosen cornmeal for its potential to re-ground an erratic electro circuitry. Thusly, the whole healing process is streamlined.\nSuggested Use: Three (3) tablets at one time a day, on an empty stomach with 6oz. of red or purple grape juice for two (2) months. After second month, one (1) a day for at least one (1) year. Or more, if needed.\n"

The defensive powers of their mind are being used up at an above average rate and their nervous energy resources are being easily exhausted. Often there is a feeling of helplessness � unable to cope. NU•TOWARD is designed to give courage and steadfastness.\nNU•TOWARD\u0026rsquo;S possibilities are therapeutic to restore energy potentials in the personality and helping to stabilize harmony. Designed to address issues like depression, feelings of loneliness, sleeplessness, anxiety, emotional hurts, doubts and worries. NU•TOWARD is Thaumaturge\u0026rsquo;s gift to troubled people to give new vitality to mind and body. Included in NU•TOWARD are the following ingredients:\nCodonopsis (320 mg): is a Chinese herb used for its tonic effect, which is mild and gentle in its nature. Especially helpful in this formula, it is a tonic to boost energy deficiency. Codonopsis (for Yin Deficiency) acts on lungs and spleen and is particularly good for nourishing the stomach. An energy tonic, Codonopsis is useful for exhaustion or convalescence.\nCurcumin (320 mg): is an active ingredient in Tumeric. It has delightful potential in its \u0026ldquo;all general\u0026rdquo; attention to inflammation in the joints and muscles. Curcumin has anti-biotic, anti-cancer and anti-oxidant properties and in action protects the liver against many toxins, inhibits platelet aggregation and helps lower cholesterol. I have included it specifically to address chronic tiredness and to enhance energy.\nAlpha-Lipoic Acid (58 mg): helps to neutralize the effects of free radicals on the body specifically by boosting the antioxidant function of vitamin C, vitamin E and glutathione. It helps too, by assuring the proper function of specific enzymes that convert food into energy. When the body is stressed due to tension, the presence of dangerous free radicals can alter the effectiveness of the immune system and one\u0026rsquo;s health is put in jeopardy.\nCaprylic Acid (86 mg): has been added to combat candida (a yeast-like fungus) which systematically invades the blood stream, migrating to other areas of the body. The longer one has the infection, the more symptoms one is likely to manifest � recurrent infections, gas, bloating, diarrhea, spastic colon, fatigue, insomnia and constipation. Caprylic Acid has been added as an anti-fungal agent to kill out the yeast. Other herbs in this formula act to build the immune system, along with the Caprylic Acid.\nWitch Hazel (40 mg): possesses a unique kind of astringency, whose main impetus of affect is on the nervous system, acting to restore tone and vigor throughout the body. It is a premier treatment for hemorrhoids. Witch Hazel lowers blood pressure, accelerates respiration and acts as a reliable astringent. In times of stress and strain, when the body is taxed with emotional disquiets, Witch Hazel helps keep the body decongested to operate at peak level.\nDMG (Dimethylglycine 86 mg): is a valuable nutritional supplement of human biochemistry. It reduces lactic acid accumulation and associated fatigue to reduce muscular pain. It is used to improve mental concentration. Research projects substantiates that DMG is a valuable aid for strengthening the immune system and increases one\u0026rsquo;s ability to perform with far greater ease. Because DMG increases available oxygen to tissue, blood pressure readings and cholesterol are reduced. When stress and tension become \u0026ldquo;overriding\u0026rdquo; the emotional strain is disheartening on the whole body. DMG then accentuates the needed resources to maintain stability.\nSuggested Use: Two (2) tablets mid-morning and two (2) mid-afternoon. Or at personal discretion up to eight (8) tablets a day.\n"

	"content": " FOR BOWEL REGULARITY NU•VALENS belongs to the collection of eclectic remedies in production by Thaumaturge. Valens is a Latin word implying vigor and strength and titles this remedy for its potential and stimulating activation of that uncomfortable paralysis of the esophagus and also the descending colon. These two areas are impulsed by specific stimuli nerve incentive. A lack of impetus can cause esophageal constriction and lower bowel complaints.\nEsophageal constriction is uncomfortable but of greater dis�ease is the fear and panic that the tightness causes. Often referred to as reflux, the problem is not that simple an explanation. Distinguishing the two phenomena can be difficult, as one is a form of paralysis of the esophagus and the other is too little production of hydrochloric acid. NU•VALENS addresses issues affecting restraints of the descending colon to relax and regulate the bowel and that uncomfortable constriction of the esophagus.\nConsider the following information ascribed to the inclusive components of NU•VALENS.\nAlpha-Lipoic Acid (46 mg); is particularly helpful in neutralizing the negative effects of free � radicals upon the body by intensifying the antioxidant functions of especially vitamins C and E and the amino acid L-Glutathione � protecting the liver cells and assisting white blood cells in killing off harmful bacteria. Alpha-Lipoic Acid helps to convert food into energy. Free radicals cause damage to cells impairing the immune system toward infections, degenerative disease and increasing the aging processes. Alpha-Lipoic Acid counters the damages and intensifies the healing impact.\nSlippery Elm Bark (85 mg); soothes irritated mucous membranes like the esophagus and the colon, the gums, mouth and digestive tract. It\u0026rsquo;s nutritive value supports in healing debilitated conditions.\nApple Pectin (63 mg); is included for its function as a fiber to remove unwanted metals and toxins from the body. It helps to lower cholesterol. It is good for constipation and hemorrhoids. But specifically, apple pectin has been added to supply additional potassium chloride for proper muscle contraction and to control the body�s water balance. Good for constipation, muscular fatigue and weakness, and salt retention, apple pectin helps this remedy work effectively.\nCopper (copper chelate 2 mg); aids in the formation of red blood cells and in energy production. Necessary for healthy nerves and joints, copper is fundamental in making up healthy connective tissue. Mid-back pain or general weakness in that area can indicate sub-clinical anemia. Low copper impairs respiratory function.\nButcher\u0026rsquo;s Broom Root (260 mg); has been added to improve circulation of oxygen especially to those areas and organs and tissues from the waist downward into the toes. With greater oxygen saturation into the bowels regular movement is re-established. Butcher\u0026rsquo;s Broom is known to reduce swelling and pain.\nNU•VALENS is an adjunct to any healing program and can be taken comfortably with other suggestions your practitioner advises. It is solely intense by itself and will, over a three-month program, give great relief and healing. You can aggressively intensify the program by multiplying the suggested use by four times. You must learn to be in control of you choices. Learn to manipulate the program to adjust you own wellness needs.\nSuggested Use: One (1) tablet before each meal or one (1) tablet three (3) times a day after a snack.\n"

	"content": " OBSTRUCTED PASSAGES NU•XYLAN by Thaumaturge is designed to deal with immune disorders which tell-tale as fibroid disfigurations resultant in gnarly and painful joints. NU•XYLAN is specific to rheumatic arthritis but the inherent potential is far greater for it also deals with vertigo, meniere�s disease, affections of the auditory nerves, deafness, sensitivity to sounds and buzzing in the ears. NU•XYLAN\u0026rsquo;s combination can also address hookworms and roundworms which often are culprits beneath arthritic symptoms. Potentially NU•XYLAN will also address enlarged tonsils when an infection is the underlying cause and helps also to quiet intense pain in the joints.\nNU•XYLAN is different operationally than NU•EGRESS although the two together as companions can add much healing when the symptoms deal with both bone and muscle discomforts, due to clogged passages like the urethra, the ears, pancreatic ducts, gallbladder ducts and similar passageways. NU•EGRESS deals with gout while NU•XYLAN deals with fibroid changes in passages that impede transportation of nutrients.\nThere are only three components in NU•XYLAN. Each is addressed for your consideration and information in the following brief exposes.\nCalcium (50mg): amino acid chelate CITRATE is more effective in smaller doses spread throughout the day and before rest, as at bedtime. One thinks of calcium for the research which credits it as building strong bones. But its aptitude also conducts nerve transmissions, aids in blood clotting and helps to regulate heartbeat. Calcium is used to repair worn out parts of the body. I chose citrate for its ease of absorption.\nYou need to understand that anything that causes the body to become too acidic seems to leech calcium out of the bones. Meat, dairy products, soft drinks and sweets are mainline culprits. Calcium chelate is easier to absorb and a keystone nutrient to improve the tone and elasticity of our muscles and ligaments. Calcium play a key role to help transport nerve impulses from one part of the body to another to promote the contraction and relaxation of the muscles helping to keep us in a calm frame of mind and to ease stress and anxiety.\nCalcium, even though in tiny increments, circulates in the blood helping to maintain a proper acid/alkaline balance. During physical or emotional stress more calcium is needed and is withdrawn from the bones and can cause much damage if not checked.\nCalcium is important for normal kidney function, to ease depression, to relax muscle cramping and to act as an enzyme activator to effect adrenal production. Calcium has many merits to give effectiveness to NU•XYLAN.\nJerusalem Oak (125mg): is an herb more commonly recognized as American Wormseed. It has a varied personality and renown amongst the early American Indians for its strengthening of the heart and its ability to promote secretions of the bronchi, kidneys and skin. Its potential gives relief to nervous affections, round worms, and hookworms, intermitted fevers and malaria. Jerusalem Oak was chosen not only as a tonic but a stimulant to urge the sick body to cleanse itself and bring rightness to its work ability. Jerusalem Oak is often called upon for it attention to affections of auditory nerves, hearing problems and infections to the tonsils thus opening tiny passages for freer flow of needed nutrients to heal. When these passages clog up hard and fibroid-like growths and swelling occur.\nCellulase (85 cu): provides digestive support as an enzyme working to break down the fiber in fruits and vegetables and grains into smaller units until it can be absorbed through the intestinal wall. Cellulase (not found in the human system) breaks down the bonds in fiber matrices which envelope nutrients in plants to increase nutritional value from fruits and vegetables. Supplementing Cellulase can improve the level of digestion to help assure maximum absorption. Cellulase is actually a complex of distinct enzymes which convert Cellulase to glucose (as simple sugar) needed in the smooth operation of metabolism as an energy source and as building blocks for making complex chemical compounds to supply the body with energy for doing any work.\nSuggested Use: One (1) tablet, three (3) times a day.\n"

Gotu Kola is said to have a positive effect on the circulatory system, deals with creative thinking, as well as nervousness, being used as a nerve tonic to promote relaxation, and creating a calming effect. It is also used to enhance memory and brain functions. It treats emotional disorders rooted in physical problems and is said to increase learning ability and decrease senility and increase longevity. It strengthens veins and capillaries and helps with leg cramps and phlebitis. Gotu Kola helps to change emotional concepts about food in general.\nMullein Leaven (330 Mg.): Mullein leaves are used in respiratory, digestive tract and glandular problems. It is used as an expectorate soothing the throat and bronchial passage, fights bronchitis, dry cough and hoarseness. It relieves stomach cramps, helps control diarrhea, gastrointestinal stress, and cramps in the digestive tract. Mullein is used to help glandular swelling.
